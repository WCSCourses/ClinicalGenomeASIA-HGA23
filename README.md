## ClinicalGenomeASIA-HGA23
This workshop focuses on the scientific principles and tools of genomic analysis and interpretation that underpin clinical research and practice

[Timetable](https://github.com/WCSCourses/ClinicalGenomeASIA-HGA23/blob/main/modules/HGA2023%20Timetable%20and%20Planner%20-%20Timetable%20draft.pdf)

## Workshop overview
In collaboration with the 14th Asia Pacific Conference on Human Genetics (APCHG), the 68th Annual Meeting of the Japan Society of Human Genetics (JSHG), and the 22nd meeting of the East Asia Union of Human Genetics Society (EAUHGS), hosted in Tokyo, Japan, we are delighted to offer this free-to-attend, 2-day workshop on the application of genome sequence technologies for clinical applications


Genome sequence technologies encompassing gene panels, whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) are increasingly becoming accessible for research and clinical diagnostics globally. Despite the growing body of data being generated, analysing and interpretation of these data remains a challenge due to limited capacity among healthcare professionals and scientists.

 
This workshop focuses on the scientific principles and tools of genomic analysis and interpretation that underpin clinical research and practice and covers the following areas:

Sequence analysis workflows for variant interpretation for clinical applications
Online variant interpretation tools including DECIPHER
Variant curation and ACMG guidelines
 
## Target Audience

The workshop is aimed at researchers and clinicians/healthcare professionals in the field of human and clinical genomics who use or plan to use genome sequence analysis approaches in their research or clinical work.

This is an in-person course and virtual/online attendance will not be possible. All participants are requested to attend all of the sessions in-person and participate in networking to benefit fully from discussions and interactions.

**The programme will cover the following core topics:**

- Overview of sequencing technologies for clinical applications
- Sequence analysis workflows
- RNAseq analysis 
- Tools for variant interpretation
- Introduction to DECIPHER
- SNV and CNV interpretations

- Challenges of clinical genomics and ethical considerations

## Learning outcomes

On completion of the course, participants should expect to be able to:

- Describe the various genomic technologies in human disease management
- Apply appropriate methods and workflows in analysis and interpretation of sequence data for clinical applications
- Apply web-based resources to facilitate interpretation of sequence variants
- Assess the structure and application of the ACMG framework for variant classification
- Discuss challenges and ethical considerations in clinical genomics
