## Workshop Overview
In collaboration with the 14th Asia Pacific Conference on Human Genetics (APCHG), the 68th Annual Meeting of the Japan Society of Human Genetics (JSHG), and the 22nd meeting of the East Asia Union of Human Genetics Society (EAUHGS), hosted in Tokyo, Japan, we are delighted to offer this free-to-attend, 2-day workshop on the application of genome sequence technologies for clinical applications


Genome sequence technologies encompassing gene panels, whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) are increasingly becoming accessible for research and clinical diagnostics globally. Despite the growing body of data being generated, analysing and interpretation of these data remains a challenge due to limited capacity among healthcare professionals and scientists.

 
This workshop focuses on the scientific principles and tools of genomic analysis and interpretation that underpin clinical research and practice and covers the following areas:

Sequence analysis workflows for variant interpretation for clinical applications
Online variant interpretation tools including DECIPHER
Variant curation and ACMG guidelines
 
## Target Audience

The workshop is aimed at researchers and clinicians/healthcare professionals in the field of human and clinical genomics who use or plan to use genome sequence analysis approaches in their research or clinical work.

This is an in-person course and virtual/online attendance will not be possible. All participants are requested to attend all of the sessions in-person and participate in networking to benefit fully from discussions and interactions.
